Detectors Maintenance
---------------------

Proper maintenance of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors ensures your home stays safe from potential fire and gas hazards. Follow these recommendations to keep them functioning optimally:

1. Regular Testing

- Frequency: Test each detector at least once a month.
- How to Test: Press and hold the test button until you hear the alarm sound. If the sound is weak or absent, replace the batteries or the unit.

2. Battery Maintenance

- Standard Batteries: Replace the batteries at least once a year, or whenever the detector signals a low battery (e.g., chirping sound).
- Long-Life Batteries: Replace the entire unit as per the manufacturer's instructions (typically 7–10 years for sealed units).
- Reminder: Consider replacing batteries when daylight saving time changes to establish a consistent schedule.

3. Cleaning and Dust Removal

- Frequency: Clean detectors every six months to remove dust, dirt, and cobwebs that may affect functionality.
- How to Clean: Use a vacuum cleaner or a soft brush attachment to gently clean the detector's exterior and vents.

4. How to Clean: Use a vacuum cleaner or a soft brush attachment to gently clean the detector's exterior and vents.

- Smoke Detectors: Replace units every 10 years, as sensors degrade over time.
- Carbon Monoxide Detectors: Replace units every 5–7 years, or as recommended by the manufacturer.

5. Placement Check

- Ensure detectors are installed in optimal locations:
  + Smoke Detectors: Inside each bedroom, outside sleeping areas, and on every level of the home, including basements. Avoid placing them in kitchens or bathrooms to prevent false alarms.
  + Carbon Monoxide Detectors: Near sleeping areas and on every level of the home. Place them at least 5–20 feet from fuel-burning appliances and away from windows or doors.

6. Interconnected Systems

- If your detectors are part of an interconnected system, test the entire network to ensure all alarms activate simultaneously when one is triggered.

7. Alarm Awareness

- Familiarize all household members with the sound of the alarms and establish an emergency evacuation plan. Conduct drills regularly.

8. Manufacturer Instructions

- Always refer to the user manual for specific maintenance guidance, as features may vary by brand and model.

By staying proactive with these maintenance practices, you can ensure your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors provide reliable protection for years to come.

Fireplace Safety
----------------

1. Ensure Safety First

Before lighting a fire, take essential safety precautions. Confirm that your fire extinguisher, smoke detector, and carbon monoxide detector are functional, including checking their batteries. Clear the area within three feet of the fireplace of any flammable objects, and use a fireplace screen to prevent sparks from escaping. Inspect the flue for blockages like animal nests, particularly if it’s the first use of the season. If the chimney hasn’t been inspected recently, hire a chimney sweep certified by the `Chimney Safety Institute of America <https://www.csia.org/>`_.

2. Prepare Kindling

Collect kindling in various sizes (small, medium, and large) to properly build your fire. For cleaner burning with less smoke and soot, use dry, well-seasoned wood that has been split and stored for at least six months. Hardwoods like oak or maple burn longer, while softwoods such as cedar or pine ignite more easily. Store unused firewood outdoors in a raised and covered area.

Important: Avoid burning trash, plastic, painted materials, or chemically treated wood, as these can release harmful chemicals into your home.

3. Open the Damper

The damper, located inside the flue, directs smoke and ash up the chimney. Ensure it’s open before starting a fire, as a closed damper will cause smoke to back up into your home. Use the handle (which may move in various directions) to adjust it, and verify it’s open by looking up the flue with a flashlight. If open, you’ll see an unobstructed view; a closed damper will block the way.

4. Prime the Flue

If the chimney feels cold—common with exterior chimneys—you may need to prime the flue to reverse the draft. Light a roll of newspaper and hold it near the open damper for a few minutes to warm the air and prepare the chimney for use.

5. Build the Fire

For an efficient and low-maintenance fire, use the top-down method recommended by the CSIA:

- Put large wood pieces at the base, perpendicular to the fireplace opening.
- Stack medium-sized pieces on top in alternating directions, forming four or five layers.
- Add small, dry wood pieces at the top, with the smallest kindling or newspaper shavings at the very top.

Light the fire from the top, allowing it to burn downward. Keep the damper open until the fire is fully extinguished and all embers are cold.

6. Safely Dispose of Ashes

If you need to dispose of ashes, proceed with caution. Ashes can retain heat for hours or even days. Use a metal shovel to transfer ashes to a metal container with a secure lid, and store it outdoors away from buildings, decks, or garages to prevent accidental fires.
